Solutions for the projects for [Linked Lists](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists?ref=lc-pb) and [Basic Data Structures and Algorithms](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms?ref=lc-pb) from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home).

Contains three projects:  
	- Linked Lists - completed
	- Searching Binary Trees - completed, Build Tree method with insert method logic taken from Hector Correa's code blogpost http://hectorcorrea.com/blog/drawing-a-binary-tree-in-ruby/13 with his permission, depth first search is only pre-order  
	- Knight's Travails  - completed, can create a hash table with all possible moves and a graph with all positions and their adjacent moves. Finds the shortest number of moves, and the path itself. However, the path algorithm may have flaws.
